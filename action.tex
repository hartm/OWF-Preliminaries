\section{A Call to Action}~\label{sec:action}
We have presented a basic use case and some details around it.  What other use cases do you, the reader, think that OWF should support?  Can you find any popular standards on these use cases?  What functionalities do these standards need to support?  If there aren't standards, can you think of the functionalities and protocols that these particular use cases would need?

Once we can agree (roughly) on the use cases that we want to support, this will in turn define the functionalities that we need to support.  Then, once we have the functionalities delineated, we can use this to figure out what the optimal overall architecture should look like.
